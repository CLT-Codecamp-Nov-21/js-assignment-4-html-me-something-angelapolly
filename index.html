            Hi, my name is Angela and I love to travel. In 2019, itching for an international escape, I took off with 
            a friend on a trip to visit the beautiful town of Banff nestled in the Canadian Rockies in Alberta, Canada. 
            Dreaming of glacier blue water, jolly Canadians, and the hopes of spotting moose in the wild we set off on 
            an epic Canadian adventure.

            <h2>Lake Louise</h2>
            <p>
              "First stop, Lake Louise. This jaw-droppingly beautiful lake is glacier-fed and the water is
              seriously that aqua. Standing in front of it, surrounded by picturesque high mountain peaks, 
              you feel like you stepped through the portal to Narnia. As if that wasn't magical enough, 
              it began to snow! Yet, admiring the lake at eye level wasn't enough for us. We opted to brave 
              a winding climb up the Lake Agnes Tea House Trail to earn a bird's eye view."

            <h2>Lake Agnes Tea House Trail</h2>
            <p>
             "When I say we braved the climb up this steep trail, I really mean it. A normally moderate hike 
             became treacherous. The snow quickly turned to ice and stubbornly determined, we inched our way 
             up step by slick step, holding on to our treking poles for dear life. Somehow, we made it to the
             top unscathed, though I'm pretty sure I spotted a helicopter air-lifting someone out at one point. 
             The reward at the top did not disappoint. Lake Agnes was like a crystal clear mirror embedded in
             the snow reflecting a white sky punctuated with snowy mountain peaks. Practically frozen, we sought
             sanctuary in the cozy tavern-like tea house to thaw by the fire and replenish our strength with 
             tea and snacks."

               If you think we had enough of exploring icy blue lakes nestled in a winter wonderland- think again.
               Next, we visited Moraine Lake, the iconic and most photographed spot in the Banff National Park And
               a dream come true for my friend, who is a landscape photographer. It was breathtaking and one of the 
               most beautiful places I have ever seen. We tackled two hikes here: the RockPile Trail that overlooks the 
               lake and the LakeShore Trail that explores the surrounding shores. However, our favorite view was 
               taken from the center of the lake in our canoe!

            <h2>Northern Lights Wolf Center</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most unique experiences during this trip was visiting a wolf sanctuary and wilderness
              refuge that rescues and rehabilitates wolves. We were able to go on a walk through the Canadian 
              wilderness alongside a wolf named Farley. It was incredible to be close to him and observe him 
              in his natural environment.

            <h2>Two Jack Lake</h2>
            <p>
              The last night of our trip was spent by this beautiful lake, capturing an image of the Milky way and
              communing with other astro photographers, late into the night. Many of which were, in fact, jolly Canadians.
              All of our hopes for this trip were surpassed, except for that elusive moose.
